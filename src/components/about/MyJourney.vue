      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 lg:text-2xl">My Journey Into Development</h2>

      <p>I began my programming journey by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, my curiosity led me to
        dive deeper into JavaScript, frontend frameworks, and backend technologies. I took part in several bootcamps and
        online training programs like HackQuest, freeCodeCamp, and many others — all of which helped me sharpen my
        technical skills and collaborate with fellow developers.</p>

      <p>
        But my learning didn’t stop there. I'm currently exploring blockchain development, learning how to build smart
        contracts using Solidity, especially on the Ethereum network. I’m also actively building in the Web3 ecosystem,
        where I aim to contribute to decentralized, open-source technologies that empower users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond Web3, I’ve developed a strong interest in writing programs using Rust. I find Rust incredibly
        fascinating,
        even though it’s challenging. Its emphasis on safety and performance really resonates with how I want to write
        code: fast, reliable, and secure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately, I’ve also been diving deeper into software architecture. I believe that writing good code is not enough
        —
        understanding how to structure systems, manage dependencies, and design scalable, maintainable applications is
        just as important. I’m committed to growing not just as a coder, but as a system thinker who builds with purpose
        and clarity.
